# Duelytics

Live site: https://masterduelytics.com/

Duelytics is a simple, friendly way to track Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel matches. It replaces spreadsheets with a clean flow that records games, updates standings, and shows progress over time.

Why I built this: I enjoy card games, and a friend asked for an easier way to consolidate matches—they were tracking everything in a spreadsheet. Duelytics grew from that idea into a lightweight tournament tracker anyone can use.

## What it does (high level)
- Records duels with a quick form (your deck, opponent deck, coin flip, turn order, win/loss)
- Updates your standing for ladder, rated, and duelist cup formats automatically
- Shows your win/loss record and current points/rank at a glance
- Supports shared sessions: a common leaderboard for everyone, plus personal stats for each player
- Tabbed navigation for fast access: Submit, Personal Stats, Deck Winrates, Matchup Matrix, Duel History, Leaderboard

## Game modes at a glance
- Ladder: Rank progression like Master Duel (wins move you up, losses move you down)
- Rated: Numeric rating (starts at 1500, can move up or down based on results)
- Duelist Cup: Point accumulation over a short period (e.g., ±1000 typical)

## By the numbers
- 3,000+ duels recorded to date

## Status & roadmap
- The live site is up and fully usable today
- Migrating to a modern React frontend for long‑term performance and flexibility; the original site remains fully functional during the transition

## Known issues
- Pages may occasionally feel slow or stagger while loading; ongoing performance improvements are planned

## Coming soon
- Faster page loads and smoother real‑time updates
- Deeper analytics (deck performance, matchup views, trends)
- Language localization for non‑English speakers
- Mobile layout polish

No install steps needed—just use the live site above.
